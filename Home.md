## About OTClient
OTClient is an alternative Tibia client for usage with otserv.
It aims to be complete and flexible, for that it uses LUA
scripting for all game interface functionality and configurations using a new file type known as OTML, that was created with the purpose to be easy for typing/reading.
OTClient works with a modular system, each functionality is a separated module,
this gives the possibility to users modify anything easily. It also allows to
extend game functionalitty with modules known as "addons", feature inspirited by "World of Warcraft", where
users can create their own game interfaces and functionality on top of the original game. The game interface look and style is completely flexible, you can change styles using a syntax near CSS and QML.
