## About OTClient
OTClient is an alternative Tibia client for usage with otserv.
It aims to be complete and flexible, for that it uses LUA
scripting for all game interface functionality and configurations with YAML files.
It works with a modular system where each functionallity is a separated module,
this gives the possibility to users modify anything easily. It also allows to
extend game functionalitty with "addons", feature inspirited by "World of Warcraft", where
users can create their own game interfaces and functionality on top of the original game.
