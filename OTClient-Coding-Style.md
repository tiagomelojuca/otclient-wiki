### Identation
* 4 spaces are used for indentation
* Spaces, not tabs!

### Declaring variables
* Avoid short names whenever possible, use readable names

```C
int a; // Wrong
int whorisize; // Wrong
int hsize; // Wrong
int windowHSize; // Wrong

int windowHorizontalSize; // Correct
```

* Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
* Variables and functions start with a small letter. Each consecive word in a variableâ€™s
name starts with a capital letter
* Avoid abbreviations
* Classes always start with a big letter.
