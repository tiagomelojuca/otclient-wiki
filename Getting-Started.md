Getting started with OTClient is simple! OTClient has multi client/protocol support which means it can run different Tibia protocols/clients (from 8.10 to 9.73/81). In order to run the different versions all you need to do is this:
* Copy the Tibia.dat and Tibia.spr from your regular Tibia client into `/data/things/<version>/` folder.

For example: /data/things/860/ this will check for the 8.60 tibia dat/spr files here.

Now you can use that client version by selecting it in the login process:
